# OS-JR-IMPL
A basic example of implementing the OS-JR framework into your project.

Simply add the 3 libraries to your classpath, copy the Hooks folder to the same directory, 
then follow the example in ReflectionClient.


# Updating
Updating was designed to be very easy. Do and update all the game accessing in OS-JR, Update the library in your client. Your client gains all updates to the osrs api, giving your client a lot of power with very little footprint.
